# üö® GOOGLE OAUTH 403 ERROR FIX

## The Problem
You're getting a 403 error because Google OAuth isn't properly configured. The redirect URI `http://localhost:3002/auth/callback` isn't authorized.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Fix

### Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup

1. **Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)**

2. **Create/Select Project:**
   - If you don't have a project: Click "Select a project" ‚Üí "New Project"
   - Name: "GameArena Tournament Platform"
   - Click "Create"

3. **Enable Required APIs:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Library"
   - Search for "Google+ API" and enable it
   - Search for "Google Identity" and enable it

4. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "OAuth consent screen"
   - Choose "External" (for testing)
   - Fill in required fields:
     - App name: "GameArena Tournament Platform"
     - User support email: your email
     - Developer contact email: your email
   - Save and continue through all steps

5. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:**
   - Go to "APIs & Services" ‚Üí "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client ID"
   - Application type: "Web application"
   - Name: "GameArena Web Client"

6. **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Add Authorized URLs:**
   ```
   Authorized JavaScript origins:
   http://localhost:3002
   http://localhost:3000
   http://localhost:3001
   
   Authorized redirect URIs:
   http://localhost:3002/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
   http://localhost:3001/auth/callback
   ```

7. **Copy Your Credentials:**
   - Client ID: (something like) `123456789-abcdefg.apps.googleusercontent.com`
   - Client Secret: (something like) `GOCSPX-abcdefghijklmnop`

### Step 2: Supabase Configuration

1. **Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**

2. **Find Your Project:**
   - Look for project: `bdcwmkeluowefvcekwqq`

3. **Configure Google Provider:**
   - Go to "Authentication" ‚Üí "Providers"
   - Find "Google" and click the toggle to enable it
   - Add your Google Client ID (from step 1)
   - Add your Google Client Secret (from step 1)

4. **Set Site URL:**
   - In the same providers section
   - Set Site URL: `http://localhost:3002`

5. **Add Redirect URLs:**
   - Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3002/auth/callback`

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. Make sure your development server is running on port 3002
2. Go to `http://localhost:3002`
3. Click "Continue with Google"
4. You should now see Google's proper OAuth consent screen
5. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to your app

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If you still get 403:
- Double-check the redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure the port matches (3002)
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Google changes to propagate

### If you get different errors:
- Check the browser console for error details
- Verify your Client ID/Secret in Supabase
- Make sure APIs are enabled in Google Cloud Console

### Quick Test:
Try opening this URL to test your OAuth setup:
```
https://accounts.google.com/oauth2/v2/auth?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3002/auth/callback&response_type=code&scope=email profile
```
(Replace YOUR_CLIENT_ID with your actual client ID)

## üìù Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Share your Google Client ID (safe to share)
2. Screenshot any new error messages
3. Check if your Supabase project has Google provider enabled

The main issue is that Google doesn't recognize your app as authorized to use OAuth. Following these steps will fix the 403 error!
